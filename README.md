SimpleMVCLab
============

Trying some basic concepts of MVC with scaffolding. 
This is probably not so interessting to other people. 
This is a very minimalistic blog example. 
I have done some basic experiments with autentication via google. 
I use Entity framework code first (with migrations). 
Apparently I use it with GIT :) 
I have also made some kind of "Hello World"-level example of using webdeploy with settings in webconfig which varies when you publish for debug or release. 
I also used this site to learn more about XSS.
